    "Based on the ethical principles oulined and following the European Commission's guidelines, we have made deliberate decision to exclude certain data attributes from our predictive model for employee turnover at HumanForYou. This decision is rooted in our commitment to fairness, non-discrimination, and the protection of employee privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Atributes Removed and Etichal Justification**\n",
    "- **Age**: this attibute has been excluded to prevent age discrimination. Using age in a predictive model could unfairly bias outcomes against younger or older employees, wich is illegal under employement equality laws and violates the core ethical principle of non-discrimination.\n",
    "- **Gender**: this attribute has been excluded to prevent gender bias. Including gender risks perpetuating existing societal inequalities and could lead to discriminatory outcomes, regardless of the model's statical findings. Its removal is essential for upholding fairness.\n",
    "- **MaritalStatus_Married / MaritalStatus_Single**: these attributes have been excluded to protect employee privacy and prevent familial status discrimination. Marital status is a private matter with no legitimate, direct correlation to job performance or turnover risk. Using it could disadvantage certain social groups and is considered a protected characteristic under many fairness regulations.\n",
    "- **WorkLifeBalance**: this attribute has been excluded due to significant privacy and ethical interpretation risks. It conflates personal circumstances with workplace demands, and a low score could be misinterpreted as an employee's lack of resilience rather than a failure of company policy. Applying it algorithmically risks blaming the employee for systemic issues and invading their private life management.\n",
    "- **AvgWorkingHours**: this attribute has been excluded to prevent unfair surveillance and punitive use of operational data. Although it is a factual metric, using individual working hour patterns to predict turnover creates a surveillance culture. It could penalize employees for the company's failure to manage workloads sustainably. The ethical response to high average hours is to review team staffing and project planning at a managerial level, not to flag individuals in a predictive system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CONCLUSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The removal of these attributes is a proactive ethical decision. It ensures our model for HumanForYou builds trust, complies with the spirit of data protection laws like GDPR, and focuses its analysis on truly actionable and non-discriminatory factors within the company's direct control. By excluding these sensitive and ethically charged variables, we focus the solution on improving managerial practices, compensation fairness, and career development paths, creating sustainable improvements for the entire organization.\n",
